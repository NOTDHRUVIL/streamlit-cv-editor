# Trad CV - Dynamic AI-Powered CV Editor

> Stop editing a document. Start managing an armory.

Trad CV is a Streamlit web application that transforms the traditional resume-writing process. Instead of a static document, your professional history becomes a structured "Armory." An AI strategist then forges a bespoke, one-page CV from this armory, tailored specifically to the job you want.

## Introduction

The standard approach to CVs is broken. Manually tailoring a document for every job application is tedious, error-prone, and inefficient. This tool introduces a new paradigm:

1.  **The Armory:** Your complete professional history‚Äîevery role, skill, and accomplishment‚Äîis parsed into a structured database. This is your ground truth.
2.  **The Strategist:** Google's Gemini AI acts as an elite career strategist. It analyzes a target job description, understands its core requirements, and formulates a winning narrative.
3.  **The Forged CV:** The AI selects the most relevant experiences from your Armory and rewrites them to perfectly align with the target role, producing a powerful, interview-winning CV in seconds.

## Core Features

*   **ü§ñ AI-Powered Parsing:** Upload your existing CV (`.pdf` or `.docx`), and the app will automatically parse it into a structured, editable armory.
*   **üéØ Strategic Generation:** Paste a job description, and the AI will generate a new summary, select the most relevant roles, and rewrite accomplishment bullet points to match the target.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Fully Dynamic Editor:** Manually add, remove, or edit any part of your armory. You have full control to add new roles, competencies, awards, or remove entire sections.
*   **üìÑ PDF Export:** Download the final, perfectly formatted one-page CV as a PDF, ready to be submitted.
*   **‚ú® Clean Interface:** A simple, two-column layout provides a focused workspace for targeting roles and editing your master profile.

## Tech Stack

## How It Works

1.  **One-Time Setup:** On first launch, you upload your most recent CV. The AI parses it into the "Armory."
2.  **Target a Role:** In the left column, paste the full job description for a role you are interested in.
3.  **Forge the CV:** Click the "Forge & Update Armory" button. The Gemini AI analyzes your entire armory against the job description and updates the data in the editor on the right.
4.  **Review & Refine:** Manually adjust any of the AI-generated content in the editor. Add or remove roles or awards to perfect the narrative.
5.  **Download:** Click "Download as PDF" to get the final document.
